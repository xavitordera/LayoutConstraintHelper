# LayoutConstraintHelper

**LayoutConstraintHelper** is a powerful utility to help developers manage and adjust layout constraints dynamically for various iPhone screen sizes, with a focus on compatibility from iPhone SE to iPhone 16 models. 

## Overview

This helper class provides an interface for setting layout constants based on device size, ensuring a responsive layout across different screen dimensions without needing separate logic for each device.

### Enum for Device Sizes

The library now uses updated enum case names for device sizes, ensuring better Swift naming conventions without underscores. Device sizes such as `iPhone4Inch`, `iPhone6Point1Inch`, etc., are supported for clarity and Swift consistency.

@IBInspectable var iPhoneSE: CGFloat = 0.0 {
    didSet { deviceConstant(.iPhone4Inch, value: iPhoneSE) }
}
@IBInspectable var iPhone16ProMax: CGFloat = 0.0 {
    didSet { deviceConstant(.iPhone6Point7Inch, value: iPhone16ProMax) }
}
